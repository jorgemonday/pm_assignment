# This program opens the w_data (5).dat file located in the same directory, and outputs the day number with the
# smallest spread between the MnT column (lowest temperature of the day) and the MxT column (highest temperature of the day).
#
# This program expects a file formatted a follows -
# File encoding: us-ascii
# Column 3:  1 or 2 digit numerical day number in a range from 1 to 31
# Column 6:  5 character maximum temperature field, with optional negative first character, optional asterisk denoting monthly high
# Column 13: 5 character minimum temperature field, with optional negative first character, optional asterisk denoting monthly low
#
# Original assignment text:
# In the attached file (w_data.dat), youâ€™ll find daily weather data.   Download this text file, then write a program to output the 
# day number (column one) with the smallest temperature spread (the maximum temperature is the second column, 
# the minimum the third column).
